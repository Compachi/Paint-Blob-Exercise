<!--    Kyle Lessnau CS4500 HW2 due 1/28/2016 
		This paint blob program is the visual representation of the same problem presented in Homework 1.
		A random spot is chosen on a 10x10 grid to be painted. This process is repeated until the 
		whole grid has been painted. Variables are used to keep track of the total number of paint 
		drops along with the max amount of paint drops found within one of the grid spaces.  -->
